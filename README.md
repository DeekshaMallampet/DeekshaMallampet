## 🔥 About Me
I'm currently in the final semester of my **Master’s in Data Science** at UMass Dartmouth, where I've been deeply engaged in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, Databases, High-Performance Computing, and Data Visualization**. My focus lies in leveraging AI-driven solutions to solve complex real-world problems. I am particularly interested in **Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and AI for data-driven decision-making.**  

Throughout my academic journey, I've worked on projects involving **Query Performance Benchmarking and UML-Based System Design**. I thrive on exploring cutting-edge AI applications and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with data.
